 # 🔐 Stylish Login & Signup Form with Redirect (LocalStorage)

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a sleek and modern **Login / Signup interface** designed for web applications that need a quick and stylish authentication frontend. It lets users register and log in using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and stores credentials in the browser's **localStorage** — no backend required! Perfect for frontend projects, demos, portfolios, or learning how authentication flows work.

It features real-time switching between login and signup, input validations, and redirection to a protected page (`page1.html`) after a successful login. Ideal for beginners and developers who want to understand local storage-based auth UI design. 🚀
